# St. Mark's Canvas Customizations

A collection of customizations to the our [Canvas instance](http://stmarksschool.instructure.org)

master
: Ready for prime time, [live on the server](http://stmarksschool.instructure.org)!

develop
: Things that we think are [about to be ready](http://stmarksschool.test.instructure.org).

dev-XXXX
: Features we're working on, forked from the most recent master/develop branch as appropriate. One feature per branch, no foolin'!

dev-blackboard-import
: Convert Blackboard exportfiles into Canvas uploads.: Features we're working on, forked from the most recent master/develop branch as appropriate. One feature per branch, no foolin'!

dev-calendar-ics
: Working on hooking up ICS feeds into and out of specific Canvas calendars

dev-archive-discussions
: Export and import discussions from account-level groups (and, incidentally, other Canvas organizational units): Features we're working on, forked from the most recent master/develop branch as appropriate. One feature per branch, no foolin'!

dev-resources-menu
: Add a Resources menu to the global navigation with a mix of links to Canvas courses, other websites, etc. Focus the Courses menu on only active _courses_ (and possibly teams or clubs). All else should be pulled out to support the student/advisor dashboard concept.
