<p><b>IMS BasicLTI Java Sample Code</b></p>
<p>
This is sample code which to support the IMS BasicLTI and IMS Common Cartridge Specifications. 
There are examples of the following in this source tree:
<ul>
<li><a href="lms.jsp">How the Learning Management System authors and launches a BasicLTI resource.</a>
(i.e. a BasicLTI Consumer)
</li>
<li><a href="tool.jsp">An external tool which supports BasicLTI</a>
(i.e. a BasicLTI Provider) - Note that this tool will fail when launched with a GET request.  It requires
a POST request with propertly signed OAuth data.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: Unpublished drafts of IMS Specifications are only available to IMS members and any software based on
an unpublished draft is subject to change.
Sample code is provided to help developers understand the specification more quickly.
Simply interoperating with this or any sample implementation code does not
allow one to claim compliance with a specification.
