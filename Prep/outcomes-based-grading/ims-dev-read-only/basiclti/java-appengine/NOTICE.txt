Hi Chuck,

I hereby grant IMS a non-revokable license to the Java code 
that I sent you on January 2 for running a demo BLTI tool 
provider on Google AppEngine.  IMS may modify, publish and 
license the code in any way that it deems appropriate, including 
changing the copyright to an Apache 2 copyright IMS, or any 
other copyright.  I give this copy of the code to IMS outright, 
with no restrictions whatsoever.

Cheers,

Chuck
