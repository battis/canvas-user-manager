An LTI idea...

In Canvas:
	- Define outcomes at the account-level
		- Use outcome groups to organize by teacher/course
		- TODO: it would be grand to include tools to reorganize existing outcomes
	- Import account-level outcomes to a given course
		- TODO: it would be grand to have a single-click link for teachers to copy a set of account-level outcomes into a course
		- TODO: it would be grand to have a course template for each department that captured appropriate outcomes (from, say, a master outcome group for each course...)
	- Use imported outcomes in assignment rubrics


In LTI:
	- Periodically cache the Student Competencies Report for a given term/account
		- Download CSV file of report (cache for n amount of time)
		- Simultaneously, cache (for same n time) the information on the Outcomes in the account	
	- Add a Course Navigation link to "Outcomes Measures"
		- Captures current user, queries against cached report
			- If current user is an admin, show a list of links to reports for enrolled students
		- Generates a summary of outcomes measures
			- Show summary of each score (most recent, average, trends?)
				- Drill down into each outcome to see assignments (with links)
				- Include outcome description, criteria
			- Collapse Groups, showing outcome group mastery as a weighted (by value of each sub-outcome) average of sub-outcomes
				- Unfold groups to show sub-outcomes
				- Allow nested groups
